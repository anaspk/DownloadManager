# Download Manager

This is a basic, multi-threaded download manager implemented by me 
and a couple of my friends as an assignment for one of the courses we
took in BS Software Engineering.

It's main features include:

1. Pause/Resume Support
1. Multiple Parallel Downloads
1. Download Progress Bar

GUI has been implemented in Java Swing.

Clone the project and open it in Netbeans to build/run it.
